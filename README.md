# ocds-ru
An attempt of mapping the raw data published on zakupki.gov.ru into OCDS 
publisher.

## Preambula
[OCDS](http://standard.open-contracting.org/) stands for Open Contracting 
Data Standard and aims for a semantic network creation of contracting 
information by disclosuring structurized data, mainly related to government or
heavily regulated companies spendings. The standard evolves starting from 2014 
and at the time of writing the version 1.0.0 is published.

In Russia the most of such spendings at their different stages of completion 
are regulated by certain laws, hereby the disclosure of any relevant data is 
mandatory via [centralized system](http://zakupki.gov.ru/). Publishing this 
data according to OCDS would be a great benefit for public interest.
