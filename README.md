# ocds-ru
An attempt of mapping the raw data published on zakupki.gov.ru into OCDS 
publisher.

## Preambula
[OCDS](http://standard.open-contracting.org/) stands for Open Contracting 
Data Standard and aims for a semantic network creation of contracting 
information by disclosuring structurized data, mainly related to government or
heavily regulated companies spendings. The standard evolves starting from 2014 
and at the time of writing the version 1.0.0 is published.

In Russia the most of such spendings at their different stages of completion 
are regulated by certain laws, hereby the disclosure of any relevant data is 
mandatory via [centralized system](http://zakupki.gov.ru/). Publishing this 
data according to OCDS would be a great benefit for public interest.

## Regulation
A number of Federal Acts regulate the activities of interest, most notable are:

* [Federal Act 44](http://www.rg.ru/2013/04/12/goszakupki-dok.html);
* Federal Act 223;
* Federal Act 94 (obsoleted by the Federal Act 44).

We will focus on the first one, and follow up the rest as it become feasible.

### Federal Act 44
The Act regulates activities aimed for satisfying state and municipal needs and 
encompasses the whole cycle of:

* procurement planning for goods, works, services;
* suppliers determining;
* contract sealing;
* contract obligations fulfilling

etc.

Notably, these are not being regulated:

* services provided by international financial organizations;
* security assurance for criminal victims, whitnesses, and also for judges etc.

Some specifics can also be different for satisfying defence needs (Federal Act 
275).

In general, any government organization or instutution, as well as any budget
institution, and in some cases companies (if budget capital invesments 
granted to them) must align the spending activities to the Act.
